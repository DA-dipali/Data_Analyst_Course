-- Note: Both tables - movies and rentals - don't have primary or foreign keys. Use only triggers to implement the above.

-- Q. For ON DELETE CASCADE, if a parent with an id is deleted, a record in child with parent_id = parent.id will be automatically deleted. This should be no problem.

-- 1. This means that ON UPDATE CASCADE will do the same thing when id of the parent is updated?

-- 2. If (1) is true, it means that there is no need to use ON UPDATE CASCADE if parent.id is not updatable (or will never be updated) like when it is AUTO_INCREMENT or always set to be TIMESTAMP. Is that right?

-- 3. If (2) is not true, in what other kind of situation should we use ON UPDATE CASCADE?

-- A. It's true that if your primary key is just an identity value auto incremented, you would have no real use for ON UPDATE CASCADE.

-- However, let's say that your primary key is a 10 digit UPC bar code and because of expansion, you need to change it to a 13-digit UPC bar code. In that case, -- ON UPDATE CASCADE would allow you to change the primary key value and any tables that have foreign key references to the value will be changed accordingly.

-- In reference to #4, if you change the child ID to something that doesn't exist in the parent table (and you have referential integrity), you should get a foreign key error.

What if I (for some reason) update the child.parent_id to be something not existing, will it then be automatically deleted?
